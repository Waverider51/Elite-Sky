	description "The Constrictor was first produced by the [***] as a response to an increase in [***]. Due to the secretive nature of the ship, with almost no details being known to the public, many rumours have spread. Many claims are absurd, like the ship being made by the [***] or having [***] involvement. However, when the ship has been spotted, those who witnessed it remember hearing words in languages they did not know, but understanding fully what the voice was saying. Even individuals not speaking Standard Terran remember completely understanding the words spoken. Also, the ship seems to be made out of extremely tough material, with sightings reporting entire anarchist fleets being annihilated by a single Constrictor."
