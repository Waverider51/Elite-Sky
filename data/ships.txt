	description "The Adder has little else to recommend it other than extreme manoeuvrability, but it's low price and reliability makes it useful in high risk mining and salvage operations. The latest Adder has added outfit space and cargo space, making them a good starting choice for beginner pilots."

	description "The Krait is an old design, originally made in the millions, but only a few are produced today. Its only remaining advantage is it's low cost - the Mamba has superseded it in every niche as an interceptor."

	description "The premier civilian interceptor, the Mamba is the next-generation Krait. Though it's not as cheap as the Krait, nor does it have the same level of customisability, the Mamba is a threat that shouldn't be taken lightly."
