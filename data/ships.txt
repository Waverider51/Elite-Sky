	description "The Asp Mark II began life as purely a military machine, the first production model entering service with the Galactic Navy in 2878. The enigmatic craft was unveiled after a lengthy period of secrecy, and immediately went into battle in the first (and most deadly) round of the Thargoid wars. In other parts of the universe, the ship was used as a patrol vessel. Once the ship was effectively superseded by the Behemoth with a bellyful of Vipers, the ship was produced under license by Zorgon Petterson Group and sold to civilian pilots. The main target market was trader escorts. It also sees use as a fast courier."

	description "The Constrictor was first produced by the [***] as a response to an increase in [***]. Due to the secretive nature of the ship, with almost no details being known to the public, many rumours have spread. Many claims are absurd, like the ship being made by the [***] or having [***] involvement. However, when the ship has been spotted, those who witnessed it remember hearing words in languages they did not know, but understanding fully what the voice was saying. Even individuals not speaking Standard Terran remember completely understanding the words spoken. Also, the ship seems to be made out of extremely tough material, with sightings reporting entire anarchist fleets being annihilated by a single Constrictor."
